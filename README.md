# Facial-Recognition-Law-Enforcement-Biometrics
Build a Facial Recognition Software system with the functionality of License Plate Registration on one Database. Software must be able to connect to mobile app so officers can login and have their profile on the app. All alerts will go to a central server and all stations will be fed information and data. Officers using App will be able to be alerted on their app of wanted people in their geographic location.
